      Hello world, <br/>

I'm Daniel and I'll probably (or try to) write some stuff here about software engineering. I'll be documenting and sharing knowledge about things I learn through my path as a software engineer or maybe something else (I also like to talk about music), I hope this will be helpful to someone else besides me. <br/>

So, a brief intro about myself: my name is Daniel Morbeck Mamão, I was born in Vila Velha, ES, Brazil. in 1999, I'm 24 right now and I'm married to a beautiful woman called Luiza. I like music from jazz to hip hop to punk rock to samba... I like playing the guitar although I'm not very skillfull I'm doing my best. I like to cook, to eat, to surf and some other things. I've been working as a software engineer for about 4 years, and started studying computer science in 2017 (didn't finished my graduation). <br/>

And why have I decided to write a blog? First, I was motivated by seeing some engineers friends I admire very much producing some awesome content (I will definetely mention lots of their work during my posts), second I like very much to talk about tech and share what I've learned, third I believe it would be a nice way to document stuff I learn in my life, so in the future I can checkout a theme I learned in the past and thinking that I will be writing something that someone else could read will probalbly be a good approach to study. By writing this hope to improve my english writing, my technical communication and knowledge, I never felt confident enough to write or teach anything and I still don't feel confident, here I will use my own words and will probably write this based on some other content that I read, watch or listen to (I will do my best to always reference where I get my sources from). And the most important point, I'm not an expert in anything, I prefer to listen and learn from other people than speaking about what I've learnt, I never think I know enough about a topic, so please if you see something that is not right or partially not right or you just want to add something, I will be glad to hear from you :) <br/>
